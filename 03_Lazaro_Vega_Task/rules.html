            <span>IHF rules shall govern MDHL play except as modified herein.</span>
            <div>
              <h2>SPORTSMANSHIP</h2>
              <span>The common interest that members of the Association share is to inspire
                youth to practice the ideals of sportsmanship and fair play. Any player, coach,
                team, parent, spectator, administrator or referee whose behavior detracts from
                this purpose is subject to disciplinary action regardless of technical hockey
                background, expertise, accomplishments or standing.</span>
            </div>
            <h2>IHF FIELD REGULATIONS</h2>

                <ol>
                  <li>U-6 play on a field approximately 20 X 40 yards with no penalty areas. Fields

            <h2>ALL-PLAY</h2>
            <span>All-play means that every recreation player on every team shall play atleast
              fifty percent of each game. Coaches in the competition program are encouraged
              to play their players 50% of each game.</span>

              <li>A Coach shall be permitted to not play a player 50% of each game
                under special circumstances, e.g., unexcused absences from practice
                and/or games, ungentlemanly conduct at practice and/or games, and
                injuries.
